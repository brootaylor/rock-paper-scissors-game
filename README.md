# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Just having a bit of fun really. This is a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game that's accessible as well - well that's the intention anyhow. The JavaScript is far too verbose at the moment so I will be optimising this considerably. That, as well as making it a bit more interactive with better us of UI inputs and feedback.


## Using / Installing
*Requirements: Node, NPM, Grunt and SASS installed globally, then...*

To install as a new project, checkout the repo and run the following commands

```
npm install
```

Should you run in to errors when using the **'npm install'** command, the best solution is to cancel the command using **CTRL+C** and then typing the following command:

```
npm cache clean
```

Once this has been done, you can once again attempt to run **'npm install'**. This may take a few attempts if you are running an older version of Node (specifically 0.10.29 or older). It's worth upgrading your version of Node if you can.

You should be ready to go!
